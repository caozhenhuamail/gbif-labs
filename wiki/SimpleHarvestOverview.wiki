The goal of the Simple Harvest is to provide a simple way to harvest data from GBIF Publishers whatever the protocol or software they use.


== Simple description ==

6 Arguments:
  # Dataset Number: _1_ 
  # URL: _http://ww3.bgbm.org/biocase/pywrapper.cgi?dsa=CameroonHerbarium_ 
  # Database: _jdbc:mysql://localhost/france?useUnicode=yes&characterEncoding=UTF-8_ 
  # Database login: _root_
  # Database password: _""_ 
  #Temp folder: _/tmp/_


Here is the process of the tool:

  * Connection to a dataset URL
  * Sending of a request (_"send me all your data"_) 
  * Retrieving of the software response
  * Parsing process (keep only the concepts that are interesting)
  * Data saving in a database
