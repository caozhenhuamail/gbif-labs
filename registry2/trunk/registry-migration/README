=== DESCRIPTION ===
This is a head start for migrating the current live registry at gbrds.gbif.org to a new DB following the new design.
The project consists of a RegistryMigrationExecutor file 

This file calls individually each ETL that is responsible for migrating each network entity (nodes, organizations, installations,
datasets, networks). 

The startup.xml is the one responsible for initializing the DB.

=== CONFIGURATION ====

conf.properties has all the information necessary to connect to the old registry DB and to the new registry DB.

=== KNOWN PROBLEMS ===
1. When running the startup.xml ETL, the 2 functions have been commented out at schemav4.sql because
for some reason they are not being parsed successfully by the scriptella processor.
Therefore these 2 functions have to be created separately when newly creating the registry DB on postgres, before running the
RegistryMigrationExecutor file.
(I ran out of time to investigate why was this happening)
Once you create those two functions, just run RegistryMigrationExecutor and things will go smoothly.

2. Datasets are not migrating the subcategory attribute. This hasn't been done yet.

3. On the live registry, there are several datasets which are being served by multiple technical installations, therefore the
installation_key attribute on the dataset table does not allow several installations. Consider creating a new intermediate table?

=== RECOMMENDATIONS ===
It is recommended to code a query (via scriptella) which checks the final product of all processes and compares if the migration was done
correctly (e.g. compare registry_old.agent vs registry_new.dataset to see if everything matches)
