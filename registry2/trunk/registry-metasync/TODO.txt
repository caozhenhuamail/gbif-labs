DiGIR:
* DOI Identifier is created but not merged with existing one or persisted yet
* convertToDataset: Make sure that we're capturing all the information we need/want
* EndpointType needs to be set to DIGIR or DIGIR_MANIS correctly

TAPIR:
* getRecordCount: Needs to be implemented
* Tapir & BioCASe: Think about what we want to do when there is an exception during processing one Endpoint. Currently the sync is aborted which might be bad behavior.

BioCASe:
* BiocaseMetadataSynchroniser#doNewStyleInventory: Needs to return information about Archives
* BiocaseMetadataSynchroniser#convertToDataset: Needs to be implemented
* BaseProtocolHandler: Not very testable because you can't inject a mock http client etc.
* BaseProtocolHandler: The Contact comparison works but it sucks that it needs to be adjusted whenever Contact changes...
