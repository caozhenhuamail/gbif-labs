DiGIR:
* DOI Identifier is created but not merged with existing one or persisted yet
* convertToDataset: Make sure that we're capturing all the information we need/want
* EndpointType needs to be set to DIGIR or DIGIR_MANIS correctly

TAPIR:
* getRecordCount: Needs to be implemented
* Tapir & BioCASe: Think about what we want to do when there is an exception during processing one Endpoint. Currently the sync is aborted which might be bad behavior.

BioCASe:
* BiocaseMetadataSynchroniser#doNewStyleInventory: Needs to return information about Archives

MetadataSynchroniserImpl:
* Remove hardcoded reference to registry

RegistryUpdater:
* This is only partially implemented especially the updating of existing datasets
