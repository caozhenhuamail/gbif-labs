This Germplasm Extension is modelled directly from the Multi-Crop Passport standard and the (proposed) EPGRIS3 trait data standard for characterisation and evaluation data (C&E). The purpose of building this germplasm extension for Darwin Core is for the development of an application schema for the GBIF IPT data publishing toolkit. The DwC Germplasm extension could also stimulate a process of further improved compatibility of the terms for documentation of germplasm and the terms and concepts used for documentation in other sub-domains of biodiversity informatics.","subject":"dwc:Occurrence","identifier":"http://rs.nordgen.org/dwc/germplasm/0.1/terms/GermplasmSample","url":"http://rs.gbif.org/extension/nordgen/0.1/germplasm.xml"},{"title":"Darwin Core Measurement Or Facts","description":"Support for generic measurements or facts as defined in Darwin Core.","subject":"dwc:Occurrence dwc:Taxon","identifier":"http://rs.tdwg.org/dwc/terms/MeasurementOrFact","url":"http://rs.gbif.org/extension/dwc/measurements_or_facts.xml"},{"title":"Darwin Core Identification History","description":"Support for multiple identification/determinations of species occurrences such as specimens.

Most of these terms are imported from the Multi-Crop Passport Descriptor List (MCPD) maintained by Bioversity International and the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO).
